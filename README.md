Hi, my name is Christo Hristov, and I am a recent graduate from Stanford University with a bachelor in Computer Science with an emphasis in Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University.  Depending on the time of day, I am 
interested in one of two things.  From 9-5 on weekdays, I am interested in how computer science and related analytical concepts can be used to model and solve pressing problems we face.  
I am interested in identifying practical issues, and designing, developing, and testing products or services to tackle these issues.  On weekends and holidays, I also enjoy playing soccer,
listening to music, skiing, and finding ways to spend time in nature.  For professional inquiries, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn at the following URL:
