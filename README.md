I’m a recent graduate with a passion for solving problems through code. What excites me most about engineering is how software frames real-world challenges in a conceptual space where creativity thrives. I enjoy analyzing efficiency, scalability, and readability, then designing and implementing technical solutions that not only solve problems but also improve people’s experiences.
Outside of work, I’m passionate about soccer, skiing, hiking, and I find inspiration in music and art.
