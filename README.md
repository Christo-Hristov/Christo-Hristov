Hi, my name is Christo Hristov, and I am a junior studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University.  Depending on the time of day, I am 
interested in one of two things.  From 9-5 on weekdays, I am interested in how computer science and related analytical concepts can be used to model and solve pressing problems we face.  
I am interested in identifying practical issues, and designing, developing, and testing products or services to tackle these issues.  On weekends and holidays, I also enjoy playing soccer,
listening to music, skiing, and finding ways to spend time in nature.  For professional or extracurricular inquiries, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn at the following URL:
